Hello, I’m Surya Mouly. Though I’m primarily a Software Developer,  I do appreciate exploring different verticals of Domains from time to time. Most of my learning comes from the internet and collaboration with other individuals.

I love being in touch with thinkers and masterminds. It leads to fruitful discussions that are helpful to me certainly, and sometimes others as well. As a Developer, I consider it's essential to be aware of various perspectives. And collecting perspectives can be difficult to do alone. From time to time, I love bouncing ideas with such people and get their thoughts on it.

Drop in a "Hi" and how about we talk design, products and tech!
